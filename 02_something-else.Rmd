This breaks because `lubridate::here()` and `here::here()` conflict, but *only* when rendering the whole site with `rmarkdown::render_site()`.

```{r loaded-packages}
search()
ls()
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load libraries anew
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(here)

# Use x from 01_something.Rmd
# THIS SHOULDN'T WORK BUT IT DOES <GRUMBLE>
exists("x")

# Do something with lubridate
my_date <- ymd("2018-04-19")

# Try to use here() and it breaks when rendering the whole site
# It works just fine when knitting this file on its own, though, since here is loaded after lubridate
cars <- read_csv(file.path(here(), "data", "cars.csv"))

head(cars)
```
